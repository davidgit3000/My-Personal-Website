      Hello! My name is David Lam. This is my first personal website where I
      would like to share interesting things about me. I am currently a junior
      transfer student majoring in CS at Cal Poly Pomona. The reason I chose CS
      is that I perceive the huge impact of technology advances on human lives.
      There are myriad of phenomenon inventions that contributes to our society,
      such as rocket, robotic prosthesis for people with disability, smart
      gloves for translating ASL. My aspiration is to become a software engineer
      with focus on AI technology. I would love new opportunies to engage in
      awesome projects in my academic journey and future career. My dream
      company is Google where talented and brilliant engineers bring original
      ideas to projects that revolutionize our techonolgy.

      As for my social background, I was born and raised in Vietnam. I came to
      the U.S with my mom in 2017. I wanted to continue high school here because
      I did not finish it yet in Vietnam, but I was too old to get enrolled at
      that point (like 20). Another reason is English is not my native language,
      so I take a while to learn it before getting into college. I started my
      academic journey at Mt SAC and received numerous supports from advisors
      and professors. They have helped me a lot going though tough time in
      community college. My next journey at CPP will be an exciting yet
      challenging experience. I always remind myself to study hard for my future
      and my family that has supported me. I would see myself as a succesful
      person in five years from now or so.

      In my spare time, I enjoy chilling out with Netflix and binge-watching
      heroic movies from Marvel. Also, I love traveling to European and Asian
      countries, namely France, Singapore, Japan, and Thai. I am into music,
      too. My favorite genres are lofi music and EDM. I usually dabble in
      learning how to play guitar, but I don't play it that well.
