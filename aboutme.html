        Hello! My name is David Lam. This is my first personal website where I
        would like to share interesting things about me. I am currently a junior
        transfer student majoring in CS at Cal Poly Pomona. The reason I chose
        CS is that I perceive the huge impact of technology advances on human
        lives. There are myriad of phenomenon inventions that contributes to our
        society, such as rocket, robotic prosthesis for people with disability,
        smart gloves for translating ASL. My aspiration is to become a software
        engineer with focus on AI technology. I would love new opportunies to
        engage in awesome projects in my academic journey and future career. My
        dream company is Google where talented and brilliant engineers bring
        original ideas to projects that revolutionize our techonolgy.
      </p>

        As for my social background, I was born and raised in Vietnam. I came to
        the U.S with my mom in 2017. I wanted to continue high school here
        because I did not finish it yet in Vietnam, but I was too old to get
        enrolled at that point (like 20). Another reason is English is not my
        native language, so I take a while to learn it before getting into
        college. I started my academic journey at Mt SAC and received numerous
        supports from advisors and professors. They have helped me a lot going
        though tough time in community college. My next journey at CPP will be
        an exciting yet challenging experience. I always remind myself to study
        hard for my future and my family that has supported me. I would see
        myself as a succesful person in five years from now or so.
      </p>

        In my spare time, I enjoy chilling out with Netflix and binge-watching
        heroic movies from Marvel. Also, I love traveling to European and Asian
        countries, namely France, Singapore, Japan, and Thai. I am into music,
        too. My favorite genres are lofi music and EDM. I usually dabble in
        learning how to play guitar, but I don't play it that well.
